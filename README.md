# Death Messages

*Note: I use DeathMessagesPrime before the rewrite and new developer you can find the new plugin [here](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/deathmessages-deathmessagesprime-remastered.3789/).*   

***I do this because the new plugin has:***
- ***Completely rewritten config***
- ***Too Many New Features (ALOT I don't need)***  

***So for now till I write my own I'll use the old DeathMessagesPrime.***
